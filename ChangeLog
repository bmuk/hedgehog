	* Made release hedgehog-2.1.

2006-02-18  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* hh_insn.def: Fixed and enabled unix-ioctl, a user contribution.
	
	* hh_builtins.def: Related changes.

2005-12-20  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* hh_insn.def, hh_builtins.def: Wrote new primitive unix-wait.

	* tests/fork.hl, hh_common.h: Related changes.

2005-12-13  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* prelude.d/500-state-machine.hl: Improvements to the syntax of
	state definitions.

	* tests/sm.hl: Related changes.

2005-12-06  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* configure, hh_seed.c, hh_crypto.c, hh_crypto.h: New files.  Take
	a shared secret from the command line of `configure', and use
	SHA-256 of it as a lisp-accessible shared secret between the
	interpreter and other trusted platforms.  Implementations for
	SHA-256 and a slightly beefed up version of XXTEA in hh_crypto.c.

	hh_seed.awk: Discarded.

	* hh_insn.def, hh_builtins.def: Added lisp-primitives
	`shared-secret', `crypto-hash', and `crypto-cipher'.

	Makefile.in: Related changes.

	* configure, hh_builtins.def, hh_insn.def, hh_compiler.c,
	hh_interp_unix.c: Ported to SunOS.  This involved sacrificing
	unix-cfmakera and long options for hhc and hhi command lines, more
	mount argument order fiddling, some includismus, and an
	unsurprising change to configure.

2005-08-16  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* configure, def2doc.c, hh_common.h, hh_compiler.c, hh_insn.def,
	hh_interp_unix.c, hh_macroexpand.c, prelude.d/interface-unix:
	Thanks to feedback and patches from a number of people, including
	luyt@ovosoft.nl, Taneli Vähäkangas, and Scott Dunlop, I added
	FreeBSD, Darwin, and OpenBSD to the list of platforms Hedgehog
	should compile to out-of-the-box (assuming suitable toolchain).
	This involved patching the instruction unix_mount, unix_umount,
	prelude.d/unix-interface, include files, configure, and predefined
	macros.

2005-08-15  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* hh_insn.def (strplit_last): Thanks to a failure report by Taneli
	Vähäkangas, moved sp-- below HH_RESERVE so that a gc triggered by
	the insn wouldn't decrement the sp twice.

	* hh_insn.def (unix_cfset[io]speed): Bugfix.  Didn't decrement sp.

2005-08-15  Kenneth Oksanen  <cessu@iki.fi>

	* Initiated this ChangeLog after publication of version 2.0.
