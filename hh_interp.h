   code and restore `ctx' to something that is possible to pass to
   `hh_error_fmt' as `aux_info'.

   I suggest using relatively large values for `n_ticks' for sake of
   reasonable performance, typically in the range of hundreds to
   thousands.

   If HH_UNIX is defined, hh_interp_step returns HH_OK and
   ctx->program_wants_to_select is non-zero, then the caller should issue
     ctx->select_retval = select(ctx->select_max_fd + 1,
                                 &ctx->select_read_fds,

				 NULL,
				 &ctx->select_timeout);
   and thereafter call hh_interp_step again.  This architecture of
   returning to the caller for select allows the programmers to merge
   several event loops to one and therby avoid a severe anti-pattern. */
